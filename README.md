# Hi! IÂ´m Joaquin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software dev student diving in the world of tech to try and find my passion.
I love creating projects that have real-world usage, mostly fun projects to solve necessities of my own.

I spent a year studing UX/UI and then decided to make a jump to web dev, where I've been coding for the past years.

As of right now, the world of AI and ML facinates me, so I'm constantly learning new concepts, techniques and workflows. I'm also starting to document my journey in tech on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JoaCortezDev).

What I enjoy the most about software development is the ability we have to craft custom solutions for our everyday life problems and the community surrounding the field.
